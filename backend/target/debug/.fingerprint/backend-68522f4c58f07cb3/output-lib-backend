This is fundamental to Rust's ownership system: outside\nof workarounds like `Rc`, a value cannot be owned by more than one variable.\n\nSometimes we don't need to move the value. Using a reference, we can let another\nfunction borrow the value without changing its ownership. In the example below,\nwe don't actually have to move our string to `calculate_length`, we can give it\na reference to it with `&` instead.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n    let len = calculate_length(&s1);\n\n    println!(\"The length of '{}' is {}.\", s1, len);\n}\n\nfn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {\n    s.len()\n}\n```\n\nA mutable reference can be created with `&mut`.\n\nSometimes we don't want a reference, but a duplicate. All types marked `Clone`\ncan be duplicated by calling `.clone()`. Subsequent changes to a clone do not\naffect the original variable.\n\nMost types in the standard library are marked `Clone`. The example below\ndemonstrates using `clone()` on a string. `s1` is first set to \"many\", and then\ncopied to `s2`. Then the first character of `s1` is removed, without affecting\n`s2`. \"any many\" is printed to the console.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut s1 = String::from(\"many\");\n    let s2 = s1.clone();\n    s1.remove(0);\n    println!(\"{} {}\", s1, s2);\n}\n```\n\nIf we control the definition of a type, we can implement `Clone` on it ourselves\nwith `#[derive(Clone)]`.\n\nSome types have no ownership semantics at all and are trivial to duplicate. An\nexample is `i32` and the other number types. We don't have to call `.clone()` to\nclone them, because they are marked `Copy` in addition to `Clone`.  Implicit\ncloning is more convenient in this case. We can mark our own types `Copy` if\nall their members also are marked `Copy`.\n\nIn the example below, we implement a `Point` type. Because it only stores two\nintegers, we opt-out of ownership semantics with `Copy`. Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2410,"byte_end":2414,"line_start":80,"line_end":80,"column_start":42,"column_end":46,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_challenger(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":42,"highlight_end":46}],"label":"value moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2462,"byte_end":2466,"line_start":81,"line_end":81,"column_start":39,"column_end":43,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_diamond(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":39,"highlight_end":43}],"label":"value used here after move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2298,"byte_end":2302,"line_start":78,"line_end":78,"column_start":49,"column_end":53,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {","highlight_start":49,"highlight_end":53}],"label":"move occurs because `name` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of moved value: `name`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0malias.rs:81:39\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m78\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m----\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mmove occurs because `name` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m79\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m        return vec![\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m80\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_challenger(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                         \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m----\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mvalue moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m81\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_diamond(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                      \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mvalue used here after move\u001b[0m\n\n"}

Then the first character of `s1` is removed, without affecting\n`s2`. \"any many\" is printed to the console.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut s1 = String::from(\"many\");\n    let s2 = s1.clone();\n    s1.remove(0);\n    println!(\"{} {}\", s1, s2);\n}\n```\n\nIf we control the definition of a type, we can implement `Clone` on it ourselves\nwith `#[derive(Clone)]`.\n\nSome types have no ownership semantics at all and are trivial to duplicate. An\nexample is `i32` and the other number types. We don't have to call `.clone()` to\nclone them, because they are marked `Copy` in addition to `Clone`.  Implicit\ncloning is more convenient in this case. We can mark our own types `Copy` if\nall their members also are marked `Copy`.\n\nIn the example below, we implement a `Point` type. Because it only stores two\nintegers, we opt-out of ownership semantics with `Copy`. Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2415,"byte_end":2421,"line_start":80,"line_end":80,"column_start":47,"column_end":53,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_challenger(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":47,"highlight_end":53}],"label":"value moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2467,"byte_end":2473,"line_start":81,"line_end":81,"column_start":44,"column_end":50,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_diamond(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":44,"highlight_end":50}],"label":"value used here after move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2312,"byte_end":2318,"line_start":78,"line_end":78,"column_start":63,"column_end":69,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {","highlight_start":63,"highlight_end":69}],"label":"move occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of moved value: `domain`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0malias.rs:81:44\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m78\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                              \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mmove occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m79\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m        return vec![\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m80\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_challenger(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                              \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mvalue moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m81\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_diamond(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                           \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mvalue used here after move\u001b[0m\n\n"}

Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2467,"byte_end":2473,"line_start":81,"line_end":81,"column_start":44,"column_end":50,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_diamond(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":44,"highlight_end":50}],"label":"value moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2520,"byte_end":2526,"line_start":82,"line_end":82,"column_start":45,"column_end":51,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_platinum(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":45,"highlight_end":51}],"label":"value used here after move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2312,"byte_end":2318,"line_start":78,"line_end":78,"column_start":63,"column_end":69,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {","highlight_start":63,"highlight_end":69}],"label":"move occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of moved value: `domain`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0malias.rs:82:45\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m78\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                              \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mmove occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m81\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_diamond(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                           \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mvalue moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m82\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_platinum(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                            \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mvalue used here after move\u001b[0m\n\n"}

Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2520,"byte_end":2526,"line_start":82,"line_end":82,"column_start":45,"column_end":51,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_platinum(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":45,"highlight_end":51}],"label":"value moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2569,"byte_end":2575,"line_start":83,"line_end":83,"column_start":41,"column_end":47,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_gold(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":41,"highlight_end":47}],"label":"value used here after move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2312,"byte_end":2318,"line_start":78,"line_end":78,"column_start":63,"column_end":69,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {","highlight_start":63,"highlight_end":69}],"label":"move occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of moved value: `domain`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0malias.rs:83:41\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m78\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                              \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mmove occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m82\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_platinum(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                            \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mvalue moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m83\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_gold(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                        \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mvalue used here after move\u001b[0m\n\n"}

Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2569,"byte_end":2575,"line_start":83,"line_end":83,"column_start":41,"column_end":47,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_gold(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":41,"highlight_end":47}],"label":"value moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2620,"byte_end":2626,"line_start":84,"line_end":84,"column_start":43,"column_end":49,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_silver(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":43,"highlight_end":49}],"label":"value used here after move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2312,"byte_end":2318,"line_start":78,"line_end":78,"column_start":63,"column_end":69,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {","highlight_start":63,"highlight_end":69}],"label":"move occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of moved value: `domain`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0malias.rs:84:43\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m78\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                              \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mmove occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m83\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_gold(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                        \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mvalue moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m84\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_silver(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                          \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mvalue used here after move\u001b[0m\n\n"}

Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2620,"byte_end":2626,"line_start":84,"line_end":84,"column_start":43,"column_end":49,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_silver(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":43,"highlight_end":49}],"label":"value moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2671,"byte_end":2677,"line_start":85,"line_end":85,"column_start":43,"column_end":49,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            self.get_bronze(token_id,name,domain),","highlight_start":43,"highlight_end":49}],"label":"value used here after move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"alias.rs","byte_start":2312,"byte_end":2318,"line_start":78,"line_end":78,"column_start":63,"column_end":69,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {","highlight_start":63,"highlight_end":69}],"label":"move occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of moved value: `domain`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0malias.rs:85:43\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m78\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    pub fn get_properties(&self, token_id: u64, name: String, domain: String) -> Vec<AliasData> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                              \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mmove occurs because `domain` has type `std::string::String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m84\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_silver(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                          \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12mvalue moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m85\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            self.get_bronze(token_id,name,domain),\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                          \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mvalue used here after move\u001b[0m\n\n"}
